# Practicing Git Conflicts with a pair

## Setup
- Fork this repository to your own github
- Add your pair as a collaborator on your fork
- Both of you should clone the repository down to your local machine

## Instructions
- Now to make some conflicts!
- Both collaborators should create a new branch
- Make some changes to the same lines
- Person A, create a PR, and merge the PR to master
- Person B, pull down the lastest changes to master, and try to merge master
  into your branch
- You should see some conflicts! Get to fixing them!
- Once you've done this, repeat the same process, only this time Person B
  should merge their PR first
